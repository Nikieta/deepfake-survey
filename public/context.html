<h2>Let’s understand the context of this study</h2>

<h3>What are audio deepfakes?</h3>
<p>
Audio deepfakes are fake or manipulated speech recordings created using AI that can imitate a human voice. These recordings may sound natural but are not spoken by a real person in the way they appear.
</p>
<p>
Audio deepfakes can be misused for impersonation, misinformation, or fraud, which is why detecting them is important.
</p>

<h3>What is an audio artifact?</h3>
<p>
An audio artifact is a noticeable characteristic or irregularity in speech that may reveal that the audio is synthetic or manipulated.
</p>

<h3>Goal of the study</h3>
<p>
In this study, we are interested in how people perceive these artifacts and how easy or difficult they are to identify. Your responses will help us understand how audio deepfakes are recognized by listeners.

<li>You do not need any technical knowledge to participate.</li>
<li>There are no right or wrong answers only your honest perception.</li>
</ul>
